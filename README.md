Symfony is a set of reusable PHP components and a PHP framework to build web applications, APIs, microservices and web services.


### Installation

 - Install PHP 7.2.5 or higher and these PHP extensions (which are installed and enabled by default in most PHP 7 installations)
 - Install Composer, which is used to install PHP packages;
 - Install Symfony, which creates in your computer a binary called symfony that provides all the tools you need to develop your application locally.

The symfony binary provides a tool to check if your computer meets these requirements. Open your console terminal and run this command:
```sh
$ symfony check:requirements
```

Open your console terminal, move into your new project directory and start the local web server as follows:

```sh
$  cd my-project/
$ symfony server:start
```
